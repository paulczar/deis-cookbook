# Deis Cookbook
The [opdemand/deis-cookbook](https://github.com/opdemand/deis-chef) project
contains Chef recipes for provisioning Deis nodes.
To get started with your own private PaaS, check out the
[Deis](https://github.com/opdemand/deis) project.

## Requirements

The Deis cookbook is designed to work with **Ubuntu 12.04 LTS**.  While other Ubuntu or Debian distros may work, they have not been tested.

#### Cookbooks

Deis depends on the following cookbooks:

- `apt` - for managing Ubuntu PPAs
- `sudo` - for managing /etc/sudoers.d
- `rsyslog` - for configuring log routing and aggregation
- `users` - for managing sysadmin users

[Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com) is used for managing cookbook dependencies.

    bundle install    # to install required gems, including berkshelf
    berks install     # to install cookbooks to the berkshelf directory
    berks upload      # to upload cookbooks to your chef server

# Attributes
TODO: List Deis cookbook attributes.

# Usage

#### deis::controller
The controller recipe will create a complete Deis controller on a single node including:

 * PostgreSQL database
 * Django API Server 
 * RabbitMQ installation
 * Celery worker service
 * Nginx site for API 
 * Gitosis server
 * Docker daemon
 * Docker-based build system
 * Nginx site for hosting build "slugs"
 * Rsyslog server

The controller will iterate over the `deis-build` databag and configure gitosis access controls in order to restrict `git push` access to repositories.

#### deis::runtime
The runtime recipe will prepare a node for hosting Docker containers as part of a Deis runtime layer.  This recipe will configure:

 * Docker daemon
 * Buildstep Docker image
 * Rsyslog client

The runtime recipe will iterate over the `deis-formations` databag and configure and start upstart daemons for any Docker containers assigned to this node.

#### deis::users
The users recipe will add systems users specified in the `users` databag that are in the `sysadmin` group and give them `sudo` access.

 * Sysadmin Logins

#### deis::proxy
The proxy recipe will prepare a node for routing traffic to containers in a Deis runtime layer.  This recipe will configure:

 * Nginx site
 * Rsyslog client

The proxy recipe will iterate over the `deis-formations` databag and configure Nginx backends for any Docker containers assigned to a given formation.

### Notes

The destination for rsyslog clients is determined by a Chef search for recipe[deis::controller], and using the `ipaddress` attribute.
